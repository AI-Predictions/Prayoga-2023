            <h2 class="title">PREDICTION <span>Model</span></h2>
            <p>A prediction model is a mathematical or statistical representation of a real-world phenomenon or system that is used to make predictions or forecasts about future outcomes based on available data. It is a tool or algorithm that learns patterns and relationships from historical or existing data and applies that knowledge to predict future values or events. Prediction models can be built using various techniques such as linear regression, random forest, support vector machines, neural networks, and many more. The choice of the model depends on the nature of the data, the problem at hand, and the desired level of accuracy.</p>

            <h2 class="title">LINEAR <span>REGRESSION</span></h2>
            <p>linear regression is a statistical method used to find the relationship between two variables, let's call them x and y. The aim of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line (represented by the values of m and b) that can predict the values of y based on the values of x. </p>
            <p>To do this, the linear regression model tries to minimize the difference between the predicted values of y and the actual values of y that we already know. It does this by adjusting the values of m and b until the line fits the data as closely as possible.</p> 
            <p>Once the model is fitted and we have the best values for m and b, we can use this model for prediction and inference.</p>

            <h2 class="title">LINEAR <span>REGRESSION</span></h2>
              <p>For prediction, if we have a new value of x, we can plug it into the model and it will estimate the corresponding value of y. This can be helpful if we want to predict the value of y for a given value of x that we haven't seen before.
              
              For inference, the model can help us understand the relationship between the variables. It can tell us how changes in x affect y and vice versa. The model can also help us identify which variables are most important in predicting y (the significance of the predictors) and assess how well the model fits the data overall.</p>

            <h2 class="title">RANDOM FOREST <span>MODEL</span></h2>
            <p>Data Preparation: First, you need to prepare your data by selecting the features (input variables) and the target variable (the variable you want to predict).
              <p>Building Decision Trees: Random Forest consists of multiple decision trees. Each tree is built using a random subset of the training data and a random subset of the features. The randomness helps to reduce overfitting and increase the model's generalization capability.</p>
              <p>Training: Each decision tree is trained on the bootstrap sample (randomly selected data with replacement) from the training set. During training, the tree splits the data into smaller subsets based on the selected features and their corresponding values.</p>

            <p>Sales Forecasting: Linear regression models can be utilized to predict future sales based on historical data, considering variables such as advertising spend, pricing, and seasonality.</p>
            <p>Energy Consumption: Linear regression models can be employed to predict energy consumption based on variables like weather conditions, time of day, and historical usage patterns.</p>
            <p>Economics: Linear regression can be used to analyze the relationship between variables in economic models.</p>
